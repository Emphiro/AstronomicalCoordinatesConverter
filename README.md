# Astronomical Coordinates Converter
 This is an interactive program to convert from equatorial coordinates to horizontal coordinates.
 
 It allows the user to set the right ascension and declination of an astronomical object and the longitude, latitude and current time of the observer. Using these values it then calculates the azimuth and altitude of the object. It also allows the user to store and load configurations.

 # Dependencies
